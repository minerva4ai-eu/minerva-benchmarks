# 🧠 Minerva Benchmarks

Minerva Benchmarks is a collection of **reproducible performance benchmarks** for large language models on EuroHPC systems.

The repository covers two independent benchmark suites:

- **Inference Benchmarks**: Serving, throughput, latency, and GPU utilization.
- **Training & Fine-Tuning Benchmarks**: DDP/FSDP scaling, throughput, memory, and time-to-train.

Benchmarks are configured per supercomputer.
